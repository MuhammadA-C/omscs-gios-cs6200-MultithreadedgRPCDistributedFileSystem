### Important to note

Georgia Institute of Technology doesnâ€™t allow students to publicly share projects from classes, but I can provide the project code to hiring managers/recruiters upon request.

### Description

Goals for project 4 were to move away from low level socket programming to higher level abstraction using Remote Procedure Calls (RPCS), and design a multithreaded distributed file system.

#### Project Parts

* Part 1: File transfer protocols (i.e. Fetch file, Delete file, Store file, List files, Get file stats) using gRPC
* Part 2: Weakly consistent synchronization system to manage cache consistency between multiple clients and a single server

### Tools

* Programming Language: C++
* gRPC library
* Protocol Buffers
* Socket Programming
* Multithreading 
* Docker
* Version Control: Git & GitHub
